Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as properties or attributes), and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods). The four main pillars of OOP are Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

# 1. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the mechanism of restricting direct access to some of an object's components and can prevent the accidental modification of data. This is usually achieved by making some fields private and providing public getter and setter methods to access and update the value of private fields.

# 2. Abstraction

Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of the object. It allows the programmer to focus on interactions at a higher level of abstraction without needing to understand all the low-level details.

# 3. Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behavior (methods) from an existing class. The class that inherits is called the derived or child class, and the class being inherited from is the base or parent class. This promotes code reuse.

# 4. Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. It is the ability to present the same interface for different data types. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding (in derived classes) and method overloading (though JavaScript doesn't support method overloading directly).

# In summary 

These four pillars of OOP (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism) help in creating a modular, reusable, and maintainable codebase by promoting the organization of software design around objects rather than functions or logic.
